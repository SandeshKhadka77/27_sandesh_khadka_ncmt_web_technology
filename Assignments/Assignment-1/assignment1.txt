  ----CHAPTER 1: AN OVERVIEW OF THE INTERNET AND THE WEB----

Group A

1. Define the term “Protocol” in the context of the Internet.
-> A protocol is a set of rules that devices follow to communicate with each other on the Internet. 
It explains how data is sent, received, and understood between computers.


2. What is the primary difference between a Web Browser and a Search Engine?
-> A web browser is software used to open websites, while a search engine is a website that helps users find information 
on the Internet.


3. Define the World Wide Web (WWW).
-> The World Wide Web is a collection of websites and web pages that we access through the Internet using a web browser.

4. Distinguish between a static web page and a dynamic web page.
-> A static web page shows the same content to all users and does not change frequently.
A dynamic web page changes its content 
based on user input or data from a server.


Group B: Long Questions

5. Explain the client-server architecture of the web with a neat diagram.
-> Client-server architecture is a system where the client and server work together. The client is usually a user’s web browser, 
and the server is the computer where the website is stored.

When a user opens a website, the browser sends a request to the server. The server processes the request and sends the web page
 back to the browser.

6. Describe the functions of the following Internet services:

Email:
Email is used to send and receive messages through the Internet. It is fast, simple, and allows sending files and documents.

FTP (File Transfer Protocol):
FTP is used to upload and download files between a computer and a server. It is mainly used for managing website files.

VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol):
VoIP allows people to make voice and video calls using the Internet instead of traditional phone lines.


7. “The Internet is a network of networks.” Explain this statement and packet switching.
-> The Internet connects many smaller networks around the world, which is why it is called a network of networks. Data sent over 
the Internet is divided into small packets. These packets travel through different paths and are combined again at the destination.
This process is called packet switching and it helps data move faster and safely.


Group C: Scenario-Based Questions

8. Startup website scenario
-> I would not agree with using a dynamic website for this startup. A static website is a more suitable choice in this situation.
In the given scenario, the website displays the same information to all users, such as company details, services, contact information,
and basic product descriptions. There is no requirement for user login, database interaction, or personalized content, which are the
main reasons for using a dynamic website.
Static websites are simple to develop using basic technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They do not require server-side
scripting or database management, which reduces complexity. This makes static websites cheaper to host and maintain, which is very 
important for a startup with a limited budget.
Another major advantage is performance. Static websites load faster because pages are already stored on the server and delivered 
directly to the user’s browser. Faster loading improves user experience and also helps in SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
Maintenance is also very low. Since the content rarely changes, updates are not frequent. There are fewer security risks because 
there is no database or server-side code to attack.
Therefore, considering cost efficiency, speed, security, simplicity, and low maintenance, a static website is the best and most
 practical solution for this startup.


9. Google website error scenario
-> The problem described in this scenario is related to the Domain Name System (DNS).

DNS is a system that translates human-readable domain names (like www.google.com) into IP addresses (such as 142.250.182.14) that 
computers use to identify each other on the internet.
In this case, the website opens correctly when the IP address is used, but fails when the domain name is used. This clearly indicates 
that the web server is working properly, but the DNS is unable to resolve the domain name into its corresponding IP address.

Possible causes of this DNS issue include:

- DNS server not responding

- Incorrect DNS configuration

- DNS cache problems on the user’s system

- Domain name not properly registered or expired

Because DNS resolution fails, the browser cannot locate the server using the website name, even though the server is active.
Hence, the error is caused by a DNS failure, where the system is unable to convert the domain name into an IP address. Fixing DNS 
settings or using a different DNS server can resolve the issue.


10. Network type for sharing sensitive data
-> The company should use an Extranet to share sensitive data securely with its suppliers.
An Extranet is a private network that allows controlled access to authorized external users, such as suppliers, partners, 
or vendors. It is an extension of a company’s Intranet, but access is restricted using authentication methods like usernames,
passwords, and sometimes VPNs.
In this scenario, the data is confidential and sensitive, so it should not be available to the general public. At the same time,
it needs to be shared with selected suppliers. An Extranet is ideal because it ensures data security while enabling safe collaboration.

Using an Extranet provides several benefits:

- Only authorized suppliers can access the data

- Data remains secure and protected

- Better control over information sharing

- Improved communication and coordination with suppliers

Unlike the Internet, which is public, or an Intranet, which is limited to internal employees, an Extranet offers the perfect
balance between accessibility and security.

Therefore, for sharing sensitive company data with trusted suppliers, an Extranet is the most appropriate and secure network type.
