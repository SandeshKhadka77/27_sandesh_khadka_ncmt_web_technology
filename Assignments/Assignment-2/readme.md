                                                             CHAPTER 2: WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
                                        


Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)
1. Define the term “Sitemap” in the planning phase.

A Sitemap is a visual or textual representation of all the pages of a website and their relationships.
It helps in planning the website structure and navigation before development starts.

2. What is the purpose of the “Launch” phase in web development?

The Launch phase is the stage where the completed website is deployed to a live server and made accessible to users on the internet after final checks.

3. Why is “Documentation” important in the development lifecycle?

Documentation is important because it provides clear information about the website’s design, functionality, and usage. It helps in maintenance, future updates,
and understanding the system easily.

4. Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development.
| Front-end Development | Back-end Development |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Focuses on the user interface (UI) | Focuses on server-side logic |
| Deals with what users see and interact with | Deals with data, server, and application logic |
| Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript | Uses PHP, Python, Java, and databases |
| Runs in the web browser | Runs on the server |
| Concerned with user experience (UX) | Concerned with data processing and storage |

Group B: Long Questions (4 Marks)

5. “Planning is the most critical phase of web development.” Discuss this statement.

Planning is the most critical phase because it defines the direction of the entire project. Proper planning reduces errors and saves time and cost.

Key activities in the planning phase include:

- Defining project goals and scope

- Understanding client requirements

- Identifying the target audience

- Creating sitemap and wireframes

- Selecting tools and technologies

- Estimating budget and timeline

Without effective planning, the project may fail to meet expectations.

6. Explain the iterative nature of the Maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly “finished”?

The Maintenance phase is iterative because it continues after the website is launched. Websites need constant updates to remain useful and secure.

Maintenance activities include:

- Updating content

- Fixing bugs and errors

- Improving performance

- Enhancing security

- Adding new features

A website is never truly “finished” because user needs, technology, and content change over time.

7. Describe the process of Information Gathering. Why is understanding the target audience important?

Information gathering is the initial phase where developers collect requirements from the client.

This process involves:

- Client interviews and meetings

- Understanding business goals

- Analyzing competitor websites

- Collecting functional requirements

Understanding the target audience is important because it helps design a website that meets user needs, improves usability, and increases engagement.

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)


8. Client wants to skip the Testing phase. Explain the risks.

Skipping the Testing phase can lead to serious issues:

Security Risks: Vulnerabilities may expose sensitive data

Functionality Issues: Features like payment or forms may fail

Compatibility Problems: Website may not work on all devices or browsers

Poor User Experience: Bugs can frustrate users

Testing ensures the website is reliable, secure, and user-friendly. Skipping it can cause long-term losses.

9. Developer starts coding without design or sitemap. Analyze the issue.

The developer skipped the Planning and Design phases, which caused the problem.

What went wrong:

- No sitemap or wireframe was created

- Client expectations were unclear

- Layout was not approved before coding

- Correct process:

- Gather requirements

- Create sitemap and design prototype

- Get client approval

- Begin development

Following proper phases avoids rework and dissatisfaction.

10. University website became outdated. Which phase was neglected?

The Maintenance phase was neglected.

Activities involved in this phase include:

- Regularly updating content (exam schedules, notices)

- Fixing errors and broken links

- Monitoring performance

- Improving security

- Updating features as required

-Neglecting maintenance causes outdated information and loss of users.
