CHAPTER 2: WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

Exam-Oriented Notes (As per Marks Distribution)

Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)
1. Define the term “Sitemap” in the planning phase.

A Sitemap is a structured visual or textual representation of all the web pages of a website and the relationships between them.
It is created during the planning phase to organize content properly and to ensure smooth navigation. A sitemap helps developers and designers understand the overall structure of the website before actual development begins.

2. What is the purpose of the “Launch” phase in web development?

The Launch phase is the final stage of the web development process where the completed website is deployed to a live server.
In this phase, the website becomes publicly accessible on the internet after final testing, configuration, and performance checks. The main purpose of this phase is to make the website available for real users.

3. Why is “Documentation” important in the development lifecycle?

Documentation is important because it provides detailed information about the website’s design, functionality, structure, and usage.
It helps developers, clients, and future teams understand how the system works. Documentation is essential for maintenance, troubleshooting, upgrades, and future enhancements of the website.

4. Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development.
Front-end Development	Back-end Development
Focuses on the user interface (UI)	Focuses on server-side logic
Handles what users see and interact with	Handles data processing and business logic
Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript	Uses PHP, Python, Java, and databases
Runs in the web browser	Runs on the server
Concerned with user experience (UX)	Concerned with data storage and security

Group B: Long Questions (4 Marks)

6. “Planning is the most critical phase of web development.” Discuss this statement.

Planning is considered the most critical phase of web development because it defines the direction and success of the entire project.
A well-planned website reduces errors, saves time, controls cost, and ensures that client expectations are met.

Key activities in the Planning phase include:

Defining project objectives and scope

Understanding client requirements clearly

Identifying the target audience

Creating sitemap and wireframes

Selecting appropriate tools and technologies

Estimating budget, resources, and timeline

Without proper planning, development may face confusion, rework, delays, and failure to meet user needs. Therefore, effective planning is essential for successful web development.



7. Explain the iterative nature of the Maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly “finished”?

The Maintenance phase is iterative because it continues throughout the life of the website even after launch.
Websites require regular monitoring, updates, and improvements to remain relevant and secure.

Maintenance activities include:

Updating website content regularly

Fixing bugs and technical errors

Improving website performance and speed

Enhancing security against cyber threats

Adding or modifying features based on user feedback

A website is never truly “finished” because user requirements, technologies, and business goals change over time. Continuous maintenance ensures long-term effectiveness.



8. Describe the process of Information Gathering. Why is understanding the target audience important?

Information Gathering is the initial phase of web development where developers collect all necessary details from the client before starting the project.

This process includes:

Client interviews and discussions

Understanding business objectives

Identifying functional and non-functional requirements

Studying competitor websites

Collecting content and technical needs

Understanding the target audience is important because it helps in designing a user-friendly website that meets user expectations. It improves usability, accessibility, and engagement, resulting in higher user satisfaction.

9.. A client wants to skip the Testing phase. Explain the risks involved.

The Testing phase is one of the most critical phases in the web development lifecycle. It ensures that the website functions correctly, securely, and efficiently before it is released to real users. If a client insists on skipping the Testing phase, it can result in serious technical, financial, and reputational risks.

Testing is not just about finding errors; it is about ensuring quality, reliability, performance, and user satisfaction. Skipping this phase may appear to save time and cost initially, but it often leads to greater losses in the long run.

Major Risks of Skipping the Testing Phase
1. Security Risks

Without proper testing:

Security vulnerabilities may remain undetected

Hackers can exploit weak authentication systems

Sensitive user data (passwords, emails, payment details) may be leaked

The website may become vulnerable to malware and cyberattacks

Security testing helps identify risks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and unauthorized access. Skipping it can cause serious legal and ethical consequences.

2. Functional Errors

Testing ensures that all features work as intended. Without it:

Forms may not submit data correctly

Payment gateways may fail

Login or registration systems may crash

Links and buttons may not work properly

These issues directly affect the usability and reliability of the website.

3. Compatibility Issues

Websites are accessed using different:

Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

Devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)

Operating systems (Windows, macOS, Android, iOS)

Without compatibility testing:

The website may break on certain browsers

Layouts may appear distorted on mobile devices

Some features may not function across platforms

This reduces accessibility and reach.

4. Poor User Experience

Bugs, slow loading pages, and broken features frustrate users. This can lead to:

High bounce rate

Negative user feedback

Loss of trust and credibility

Reduced customer engagement

A poor first impression can permanently damage the website’s reputation.

5. Financial and Business Loss

Skipping testing can result in:

Increased maintenance cost after launch

Emergency bug fixes

Loss of customers and revenue

Damage to brand image

Fixing errors after launch is always more expensive than preventing them during testing.

Conclusion

The Testing phase ensures that the website is secure, functional, compatible, and user-friendly. Skipping it exposes the project to serious risks and long-term losses. Therefore, testing is essential and should never be ignored in professional web development.

9. A developer starts coding without creating a design or sitemap. Analyze the issue.

Starting development without proper planning and design is a major violation of the web development lifecycle. The Planning and Design phases serve as the foundation of a successful website. When a developer begins coding without a sitemap or design, it leads to confusion, inefficiency, and project failure.

What Went Wrong
1. Absence of Sitemap

A sitemap defines:

Website structure

Page hierarchy

Navigation flow

Without a sitemap:

Pages are created randomly

Navigation becomes confusing

Content organization is poor

Users struggle to find information

The website lacks logical flow and structure.

2. No Wireframe or Design Prototype

Design acts as a visual blueprint. Without it:

Layout decisions are made during coding

UI/UX principles are ignored

Client expectations are unclear

Frequent design changes occur

This leads to repeated rework and wasted effort.

3. Lack of Client Approval

Without design documentation:

Client cannot visualize the final product

Misunderstandings arise

Final output may not meet expectations

Client dissatisfaction increases

Approval before development is crucial to avoid conflicts.

4. Increased Development Time and Cost

Coding without planning causes:

Redundant code

Structural changes midway

Debugging difficulties

Increased project duration

Proper planning always saves time and resources.

Correct Web Development Process

To avoid such issues, the correct sequence should be:

Requirement gathering

Information analysis

Sitemap creation

Wireframe and UI design

Client review and approval

Development (coding)

Testing and deployment

Each phase supports the next, ensuring clarity and efficiency.

Conclusion

Skipping design and sitemap creation results in poor structure, user dissatisfaction, and project failure. Proper planning and design are essential for organized development and successful project delivery.
