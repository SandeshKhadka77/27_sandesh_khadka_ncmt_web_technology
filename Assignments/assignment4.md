CHAPTER 4: WEBSITE DESIGN PRINCIPLES
Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)
1. Differentiate between Legibility and Readability.

Alternative & Expanded Answer:
Legibility and readability are closely related but refer to different aspects of text presentation.

Legibility is concerned with how easily individual characters and letters can be recognized. It mainly depends on the typeface design, font size, letter spacing, and contrast between text and background. For example, a font with clear letter shapes is more legible than one with overly decorative styles.

Readability, on the other hand, focuses on how easily a reader can understand and comfortably read a block of text. It depends on factors such as line length, paragraph spacing, font pairing, alignment, and the complexity of the written content. A text can be legible but still hard to read if it is poorly structured or overcrowded.

2. What is the Rule of Thirds in layout design?

Alternative & Expanded Answer:
The Rule of Thirds is a visual design principle used to create balanced and engaging layouts. In this rule, the page or screen is divided into nine equal parts by drawing two horizontal and two vertical lines, forming a 3×3 grid.

Designers place important visual elements along these lines or at their intersections rather than placing them directly in the center. This technique creates a more natural flow for the viewer’s eyes and makes the layout feel dynamic and visually appealing. The Rule of Thirds is widely used in web design, photography, and graphic design to improve composition and focus.

3. Why should you limit the number of font families used on a website?

Alternative & Expanded Answer:
Limiting the number of font families on a website is important for both usability and performance reasons.

Improved Performance: Each font family requires additional files to be downloaded. Using too many fonts increases loading time, which negatively affects user experience.

Visual Consistency: A limited number of fonts helps maintain a clean, organized, and professional appearance across the website.

Better Readability: Consistent typography makes it easier for users to scan and understand content.

Clear Hierarchy: Using one font for headings and another for body text helps users quickly identify important information.

Generally, using two fonts (one for headings and one for body text) or a maximum of three fonts is considered best practice.

4. Define Responsive Web Design.

Alternative & Expanded Answer:
Responsive Web Design (RWD) is an approach to web development that ensures a website adapts smoothly to different screen sizes and devices. It allows content to automatically adjust its layout, images, and text so that users have an optimal viewing experience whether they are using a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.

Responsive design reduces the need for zooming, horizontal scrolling, and manual resizing. It is achieved using flexible layouts, fluid images, and CSS media queries, making websites more accessible and user-friendly.

5. Explain the F-Pattern of scanning and its influence on content placement.

Alternative & More Detailed Answer:
The F-Pattern is a common eye-movement pattern observed when users scan text-heavy web pages such as blogs, news sites, and documentation pages. Eye-tracking research shows that users do not read every word; instead, they scan content quickly to find relevant information.

Typically, users first scan horizontally across the top portion of the page, forming the top bar of the “F”. Then they move slightly downward and scan another horizontal line, which is usually shorter. Finally, they scan vertically down the left side of the page, forming the stem of the “F”.

This behavior has a strong influence on web design. Designers should place important elements such as logos, headings, navigation menus, and call-to-action buttons in areas that naturally attract attention—especially the top and left sections. Less important content can be placed toward the right or lower parts of the page. Designing with the F-Pattern in mind improves content visibility, user engagement, and overall usability.

6. Discuss the psychological impact of colors in web design with examples.

Alternative & More Detailed Answer:
Colors play a powerful psychological role in web design because they influence emotions, perceptions, and user behavior. Choosing the right color palette helps communicate a brand’s message effectively.

Blue: Blue is associated with trust, security, calmness, and professionalism. It is commonly used by banks, technology companies, and corporate websites. For example, platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, and PayPal use blue to build user confidence and reliability.

Red: Red is a strong, attention-grabbing color linked to energy, urgency, excitement, and passion. It is often used for call-to-action buttons, alerts, discounts, and food-related businesses. Brands like Netflix and Coca-Cola use red to create emotional intensity and prompt quick user action.

Green: Green symbolizes nature, health, balance, growth, and freshness. It is easy on the eyes and often used for environmental, wellness, and finance-related websites. Companies like Starbucks and Whole Foods use green to represent sustainability and well-being.

Understanding color psychology helps designers create websites that emotionally connect with users and support business goals.

7. Explain the 60-30-10 Rule in website color balance.

Alternative & More Detailed Answer:
The 60-30-10 Rule is a classic design guideline used to create visually balanced and harmonious color schemes in web design.

60% – Primary Color:
This is the dominant color and usually covers the background and large sections of the website. It is often neutral or soft so that it does not overwhelm users and allows content to stand out.

30% – Secondary Color:
This color supports the main color and is used for elements like headings, menus, sidebars, or cards. It adds visual contrast and helps define sections of the page.

10% – Accent Color:
The accent color is bold and eye-catching. It is used sparingly for call-to-action buttons, links, icons, or highlights. Because it is used minimally, it effectively draws attention where needed.

Using this rule helps designers maintain clarity, balance, and visual appeal without making the design look chaotic.

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)
8. Importance of Image Optimization and JPEG vs PNG formats.

Alternative & More Detailed Answer:
Image optimization is a critical aspect of web performance and user experience. Large, unoptimized images significantly slow down website loading times, which can frustrate users and increase bounce rates. Slow websites also perform poorly in search engine rankings.

High-resolution raw images taken directly from cameras are not suitable for web use because they contain excessive data. Image optimization reduces file size while maintaining acceptable visual quality. This leads to faster loading times, reduced server load, and better overall performance.

Choosing the correct image format is equally important:

JPEG:
JPEG is ideal for photographs and complex images with many colors and gradients. It uses lossy compression, which removes some data to reduce file size. The quality loss is usually unnoticeable, making JPEG perfect for web photos.

PNG:
PNG is best for logos, icons, illustrations, and images requiring transparency. It uses lossless compression, preserving image quality and sharp edges. However, PNG files are generally larger than JPEGs.

By optimizing images and choosing the right format, websites become faster, more efficient, and more user-friendly.

9. Critique a bright yellow background with Comic Sans for a law firm.

Alternative & More Detailed Answer:

Critique:
A bright yellow background is visually aggressive and can cause eye strain, making it unsuitable for a professional law firm website. It fails to convey seriousness, trust, and authority. Comic Sans, being playful and informal, undermines the credibility of a legal institution and may make the firm appear unprofessional.

Better Alternatives:

Typography:

Serif Fonts (e.g., Garamond, Times New Roman): Convey tradition, reliability, and professionalism.

Sans-Serif Fonts (e.g., Helvetica, Open Sans): Offer a modern, clean, and efficient look while maintaining professionalism.

Color Scheme:

Navy Blue or Charcoal Gray: Symbolize trust, stability, and authority.

White or Gold Accents: Add elegance, clarity, and sophistication without overwhelming the design.

These alternatives align better with the expectations and psychology of clients seeking legal services.

10. Identify the missing principle and explain Media Queries & Fluid Grids.

Alternative & More Detailed Answer:
The missing design principle in this scenario is Responsive Web Design. A non-responsive website fails to adapt to different screen sizes, forcing users to zoom and scroll horizontally, which leads to a poor mobile experience.

Media Queries:
Media queries allow designers to apply different CSS rules based on screen size, resolution, or device type. For example, layouts can switch from multi-column on desktops to single-column on mobile devices, improving readability and navigation.

Fluid Grids:
Fluid grids use relative units like percentages instead of fixed pixels. This allows elements to resize proportionally based on screen width. As a result, the layout automatically adjusts to various devices without breaking.

Together, media queries and fluid grids ensure content remains readable, accessible, and visually consistent across all devices.
